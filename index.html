<!-- A CDN (Content Delivery Network) link is a URL that directs users to a specific piece of content hosted on a CDN server. Instead of fetching content directly from the origin server (where your website is hosted), the CDN provides a cached copy of the content from a server closer to the user's location, resulting in faster loading times -->

// order of script tags do matter for execution of the code 


// package.json file is configuration for npm
// npm is a package manager , it manages all packages that will install in our system
// npm is not node package manager
// packages are like dependecies 
// webpack , vite , parcel uses buddler . so buddler bundle up the needed code to make production level code execution
// create-react app uses buddler behind the scenes 
// there are two types of dependecies 1.dev dependecies(packages) 2.normal dependecies 
// dev dependecies is used while we developing our app and normal dependecies are used in production
// npm install -D parcel
// -D means dev dependecies
// package-loc.json keep tracks the exact version of all the dependecies
// In package-loc.json hash which is located in integrity , hash makes local machine code working to production level working code 
// you don't need to push node modules to git u can regenerate it from package and package-lock.json with using command (npm install) 
// transitive dependencies
// In the context of software or database design, a transitive dependency is an indirect dependency, meaning that one component relies on another, which in turn relies on a third component. This creates a chain of dependencies where the original component is indirectly reliant on the final component

//npm used for installing a package and npx used for executing a package
// What is the difference between NPX and NPM medium? NPM is a package management that is used to install, uninstall, and update Javascript packages on your workstation, whereas NPX is a package executer that is used to directly execute Javascript packages without installing them.

<!-- npm init to start creating package.json with given information-->
<!-- npm install -D parcel to install parcel  -->
<!-- npm install used to install node modules and package-lock.json-->
 <!-- if u delete node modules and wanna recreate it so write npm install -->
<!-- npx parcel index.html  to start the server -->
<!-- npm install react to install react-->
<!-- npm i react-dom to install react-dom-->
<!-- npm run start  -->
<!-- npm run build  -->
<!-- .parcel-cache is used by parcel(bundler) to reduce the building time. It stores information about your
project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze everything
from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel can be so fast in development mode. -->
<!-- u can delete dist and .parcel cache and recreate while running server -->
 <!-- dist is making production ready app for you it bundles the thing up -->
